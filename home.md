# Somebodies Knowledge Base

Hi there, welcome and nice to have you here! ðŸ‘‹

This knowledge base primarily focuses on â€¦

Obviously this is an every-growing and never-finished project and we are always looking for help. If you have expertise you would like to share, please read about [[Contributing]]!

## ðŸ“– How to browse
Since a growing network of knowledge can never be put into a linear structure in the long term, we do not even try to provide a navigation  that will take you to every corner of this knowledge base. 

Instead, we collectively compile starting points and collections, which might help certain people with certain questions to find and relate the relevant information. 

We call these **Maps of Content** or just **ðŸ§­ map**, which is like a local guide or navigation structure for a certain topic or part of our knowledge network. Whenever an area or group of topics grows beyond a certain scale or a specific path through the network is often required, it might be a good idea to create an MAP for these. 

All the maps (and some additional pages we would like to highlight) are available through the [[ðŸ‘‰ Index]].

## ðŸ”­ Exploration is key! 
Apart from these maps, we encourage you to explore and discover! Most articles densly link to others and will take you on a walk through knowledge space. In addition, you can use the [[graph]]. Whether you are looking for a specific piece of information or are just here to wander around - enjoy!
